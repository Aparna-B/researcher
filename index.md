## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="website_image.jpg">

Hi! I am a Research Software Engineer at Winterlight Labs. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a Masters degree in Applied Computing in 2019. I graduated with honors from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati in 2017. I am interested in research and applications of machine learning for healthcare. Here is my [CV](https://aparna-b.github.io/researcher/resume.pdf).

## Research Interest

My research interests include clinical natural language processing and machine learning for healthcare. Currently, I am working on research projects in the fields of domain adaptation with unsupervised techniques, machine learning, and speech processing for healthcare applications.
